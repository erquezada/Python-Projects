# Python-Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects and scripts that I have created as part of my learning and development in Python programming.

Getting Started
To run any of these projects on your own machine, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, simply clone or download this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory you want to run. Then, run the main script using the command:

python filename.py

Please note that filename refers to the name of the file. So for example if you have a file named:
helloworld.py

To run the program on your machine you would do so like this:

python helloworld.py
